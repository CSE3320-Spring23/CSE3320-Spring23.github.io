  This assignment we will explore how to use some of the features of
  the git and GitHub. 

  ##Task 1: Setup GitHub
    All of your work in this class will be submitted to [GitHub] using [git].
    Your first task is to setup your [GitHub] **assignments** repository by doing
    the following:
    1. **Sign-in** or create a [GitHub] account if you do not already have one.
        > [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join)
        You may associate this account with either your UTA or personal
        email address.  It is up to you.

    2. Before you can **clone** your [git] repository, you will need to
    determine which form of **authentication**, you wish to use with [GitHub].
        <div class="alert alert-danger" markdown="1">
        **Note**, that [GitHub] has recently shut down [password authentication].
        </div>
        To remotely access your repository from the command-line, you have two options:
        1. [Setup a Personal Access Token]: With this method, [GitHub] will
          generate an application specific passsword that you can use with
          **HTTPS**.  As the **PAT** is a long string of characters, it is
          recommended that you use it in conjunction with a **password
          manager** or **keyring**.
        2. [Setup SSH Keys]: With this method, you generate a local public and
          private key pair on your computer and then upload the **public key**
          to [GitHub].  When accessing [GitHub] from the command-line, you will
          use the **private key** to authenticate to the server.
            This is the **recommended** way to setup your repository as it will
            allow for **passwordless** access.

        #### <i class="fa fa-lock"></i> Setup SSH Keys
        <p>Here is a quick tutorial on how to [Setup SSH Keys] on a Linux
        or MacOS machine (if you have not already):</p>
        1. Generate SSH keys if you don't have them yet:
                :::bash
                # Accept the defaults, don't make a password if you want to go passwordless
                $ ssh-keygen
        2. Copy the contents of `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the SSH Keys section of
        your [GitHub] settings page:
            > [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys)
                :::bash
                # Copy and paste the contents of this file into GitHub
                $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        3. Edit/create `~/.ssh/config` to use this key with [GitHub]:
                :::bash
                # Add the following to your config (replace $USERNAME with your username)
                $ vim ~/.ssh/config
                Host github.com
                        User git
                        Hostname github.com
                        PreferredAuthentications publickey
                        IdentityFile /home/$USERNAME/.ssh/id_rsa
        Once this is done, you should be able to do [git] operations without a password.
        You will need to accept the host key the first time by typing in "yes".

        #### <i class="fa fa-code"></i> Text Editor
        Any time you see references to `vim` in example commands, remember that
        you can use any text editor such as `nano` or `emacs` instead.
